# UPDATE:
The Creator has instructed that we only use the vault for all updates. Read the commits especially the extended descriptions on MCBCMF/MCBCMassacre 

# welcome
Bringing to your attention to [The Massacre at Mount Calvary Baptist Church](https://github.com/mission23/mission23/wiki/The-Massacre-at-Mount-Calvary-Baptist-Church) on the first Sunday in April is the number one priority for the Creator and His servants at this time and the reason for the biggest shake event this morning. 

One you've read that, you should understand why He decided to [ring the bell](https://github.com/Mission23/mission23/wiki/The-Ringing-Of-The-Bell).

# warning
The CIA has deployed a lookalike for me wearing my actual clothes stolen from my house. Watch this video and please share this widely. Make sure to link back to https://github.com/mission23 so people can get some background information.
