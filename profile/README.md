# welcome
Bringing to your attention to [The Massacre at Mount Calvary Baptist Church](https://github.com/mission23/mission23/wiki/The-Massacre-at-Mount-Calvary-Baptist-Church) on the first Sunday in April is the number one priority for the Creator and His servants at this time and the reason for the biggest upcoming shake event. 

One you've read that, you should understand why He decided to [ring the bell](https://github.com/Mission23/mission23/wiki/The-Ringing-Of-The-Bell).

## repository
The original repository MCBCMF/MCBCMassacre was setup in a way that it cannot be deleted and updates can occur from only one secured device. We consider it the vault. 

Due to recent activity, we've suspended updates to our fork and are only making commits there. 

If you haven't already, please clone the repository and fetch/pull often. The more clones we have the more difficult this becomes to keep hidden.
